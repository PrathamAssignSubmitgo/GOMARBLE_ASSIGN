#README: Selenium-Gemini Workflow with Local LLM Integration

#Overview

This project began with a locally hosted LLM (Large Language Model) for automated data analysis and interaction. However, scaling the local setup was challenging. To address this, we transitioned to a more scalable solution using Selenium for web interaction and a custom LLM hosted on Gemini. This new approach streamlines web data extraction, processing, and analysis.

#How It Works

#1. Moving from Local to Cloud

Initially, a locally hosted LLM handled processing. While effective for small tasks, it struggled with resource demands. Switching to Gemini's cloud-hosted LLM brought:

Automated code suggestions.

HTML and CSS analysis.

Smarter decisions for pagination and navigation.

#2. Web Automation with Selenium

Selenium manages web interactions in a Debian environment by:

Identifying essential elements like buttons, forms, and CSS.

Analyzing page structures to determine optimal interaction methods.

3. CSS and Pagination Management

The Gemini-powered LLM:

Examines extracted CSS for better pagination strategies.

Suggests button placements for smoother navigation.

The workflow dynamically selects the most relevant navigation elements to ensure accurate progression through paginated content.

4. Fetching Data During Transitions

When navigating between pages (e.g., Page 1 to Page 2):

Comments and other data are fetched independently via APIs.

This ensures data loads quickly and doesn’t delay page transitions.

5. Cleaning and Exporting Data

Fetched data is:

Cleaned and preprocessed.

Exported into an Excel sheet for further analysis.

6. Advanced Analysis with LLM

The Excel data is processed by the LLM to:

Summarize key topics and trends from comments.

Create detailed visualizations, such as:

NetworkX graphs: Highlighting relationships and connections.

Neo4j graphs: Offering deeper structural insights.

Key Features

Seamless Automation: Selenium handles web interaction and data extraction efficiently.

Smart Integration: Gemini’s LLM analyzes HTML, CSS, and navigation strategies.

Dynamic Data Fetching: Retrieves comments and content asynchronously during transitions.

Insightful Analysis: Produces topic summaries and advanced visualizations.

Scalable Design: Combines local automation with cloud-based intelligence for high performance.

Requirements

Operating System: Debian-based environment.

Software:

Selenium WebDriver.

Gemini (for LLM integration).

Python libraries: pandas, NetworkX, Neo4j, etc.

APIs: Endpoints for fetching comments and related data.

Getting Started

Step 1: Setup

Install dependencies: Selenium, required Python libraries, and Gemini integration.

Configure API endpoints for data fetching.

Step 2: Run the Workflow

Launch the Selenium script to begin web interaction.

Use Gemini’s LLM for analysis and navigation guidance.

Step 3: Process Data

Allow the script to fetch and clean comments.

Export the cleaned data into an Excel file.

Step 4: Analyze and Visualize

Load the Excel file into the LLM for insights and trends.

Generate NetworkX and Neo4j graphs for a deeper understanding of relationships.
