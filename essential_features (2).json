This helps reduce inflammation (easing muscle soreness and body pain), promote tissue repair (helping your muscles recover faster), and improve circulation (delivering nutrients to sore or damaged areas for quicker healing).\nOptiMSM\nThe purest form of MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane), sourced in the United States, and helps with joint health (reducing stiffness and discomfort), skin health (improving elasticity and reducing signs of aging), and muscle recovery (helping sore muscles feel better)\nArnica Extract\nSourced from the Arnica Montana Plant, a yellow flower that grows in mountain regions that's packed with natural compounds like helanins and flavonoids which help naturally calm the feeling of pain while to boosting blood flow to help prevent bruising and speed up the healing of broken blood vessels.\nEssential Oils\nA blend of 27 Muscle Essential Oils each intentionally and purposefully selected to give a soothing sensation, non-greasy texture, and uplifting aroma.\nFormulated For Deep Penetration\nThe Relief & Recovery Cream's blend of GHK-Cu (copper peptide), terpenes, and essential oils promote recovery by addressing the source of your discomfort rather than masking it. Penetrating deep through the skin and down to the bone, relieving your discomfort in the process.\nReal Relief For Real People.\nIt\u2019s tough to be your best when you\u2019re not feeling your best.\nIt's tough to work, to exercise, to focus, even to relax when you're in pain\nAnd truth is, anyone on the path of being a little better today than they were yesterday is likely to have some aches in the process.\nWhich is why we've even partnered up with chiropractors like Dr. Camacho to create the perfect recovery product to get you back in the game.\nRelief on your schedule.\nSubscribe to our recurring subscription program and recieve $5 off of your order, delivered at your pace, on your schedule.\nNeed a new bottle every month?
